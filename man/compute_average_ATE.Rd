\arguments{
\item{output}{a list containing the outputs of the estimation of the bounds on the ATE for the periods between 1 and Tinf.}

\item{Option}{chosen method to compute the ATE: either sharp or quick. Default is quick.}

\item{Tinf}{vector of size n x1 containing the number of periods observed for each individual.}

\item{selectX}{the number of covariates}

\item{CIOption}{the option for the choice of the type of confidence intervals for the quick method, either CI2 or CI3. Default is CI2.}

\item{alpha}{the confidence level for the confidence intervals. Default is 5\%.}

\item{g_labels}{a matrix nx1 containing the individual labels refering to the type of attrition observed and described in the table G_types.}

\item{G_types}{a matrix describing the different possible types of attrition observed in the dataset}

\item{G_indic}{a matrix nxT containing the individual periods observed (0 if unobserved)}
}
\value{
A list containing the values of : Option, n, Tmax,

 - Delta_hat: either the estimator of the bounds on the average of Delta ATE (sharp method) or the approximation of Delta ATE (quick method) over the periods;

 - length_CI: the length of the confidence intervals;

 - et: the estimated standard error of the influence function(s), either of the two bounds on the average of Delta ATE (sharp method) or of
 the approximation of Delta ATE (quick method);

 - bias_sup: the estimated upper bound on the bias (quick method);

 - CI: the confidence intervals at the alpha level;

 - b_hat: the estimated value of beta0 using the conditional maximum likelihood estimator;

 - std_b: the estimated standard deviation of the inflence function of the  conditional maximum likelihood estimator of beta;

 - influence: the matrix of size n x dimX containing the inflence function of the  conditional maximum likelihood estimator of beta;
