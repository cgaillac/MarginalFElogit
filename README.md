# MarginalFElogit
 
The R package MarginalFElogit is associated to Davezies, D’Haultfoeuille, and Laage (2021) https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00879, DDL hereafter. This package considers inference about average marginal effects (AME) and similar parameters in a panel data fixed effects logit model. It implements the nonparametric estimator of the sharp bounds on the AME and the related confidence intervals on the AME from DDL.  It also implements the second method proposed in DDL, which does not require any nonparametric estimation but may result in larger confidence intervals. Several simulated and real examples illustrating the usage of MarginalFElogit are given in the associated vignette.

See the RationalExp's vignette for theoretical details and code examples.
